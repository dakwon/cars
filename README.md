This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.

# CARS
 
The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
  * If the user types 1, he will be asked to put **year**, **company**, and **model** of the car.
  * If the user types 2, the computer will display the **list** of cars.
  * If the user types 3, he can quit and exit the program.
